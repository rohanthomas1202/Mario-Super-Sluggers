Use programming fundamentals (loops, functions, arrays and file-based I/O) to construct a program in Java


# Problem:
Now that the Mushroom Kingdom League has ended and crowned a new champion, it is time to determine the league leaders in several different baseball categories.  Being the only person in the Mushroom Kingdom that knows how to write a computer program, you have been asked by Princess Peach herself to write a program that will determine the league leaders. 

# Details:
The file you submit will be named Main.java. Start the program by prompting the user for the input filename. Stats will be calculated for the following categories 1:Batting average = hits / at-bats. 2:On-base percentage = (hits + walks + hit by pitch) / plate appearances 3:Calculate all stats per person and record the highest value for each category. There may be ties for the leaders. If there is a tie, output all names for tied valueoStrikeout (K) leaders will be batters with the smallest value. Arrays must be implemented in the program. Consider using an array for each category in parallel. The size of each array will be 30. Search through the arrays to find the league leaders. The program must use a minimum of 3 functions other than main. Remember each major,logical piece of the program should be a separate functionâ€¢The main function must call at least 3 of the functions you create. Any global variables used must be constant. Use as few variables as possible.
